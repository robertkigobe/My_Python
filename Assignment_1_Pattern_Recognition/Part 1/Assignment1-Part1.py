#Setup the column names

# ## Generate descriptive statistics can be achieved with dataset.describe()

# Descriptive statistics include those that summarize the central tendency, dispersion and shape of a datasetâ€™s distribution, excluding NaN values.Analyzes both numeric and object series, as well as DataFrame column sets of mixed data types. The output will vary depending on what is provided.

# ## Box or whisker Plots
# 

# A Box Plot is also known as Whisker plot is created to display the summary of the set of data values having properties like minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum. In the box plot, a box is created from the first quartile to the third quartile, a vertical line is also there which goes through the box at the median. Here x-axis denotes the data to be plotted while the y-axis shows the frequency distribution.

# In[9]:



dataset.plot(kind='box', subplots=True, layout=(7,5), sharex=False, sharey=False, figsize=(20,30))
plt.show()


# According to the box plots, it can be seen that the kernel groove length has the median far away from the true middle of the box which could indicate that the data is skewed for the column.

# In[10]:


# histograms
dataset.hist(figsize=(10,10))
plt.show()


# considering the assymentry coefficient, compactness, we see that the the histograms are bell shaped incating that the data is uni modal.thus a good sign of good data distribution.
# 
# considering area,perimeter,kernel length and kernel width, the histograms are Right-Skewed. this is an indication that this is a unimodal data set, with the mode closer to the left of the graph and smaller than either the mean or the median. This also indicated that the mean is located to the right side of the graph and will be a greater value than either the median or the mode. This shape indicates that there are a number of data points, perhaps outliers, that are greater than the mode.
# 
# The kernel groove length has two bell shapes indicating bi-modal behavior

# ## scatter plot matrix

# In[11]:



scatter_matrix(dataset, figsize=(10,10))
plt.show()


# there is a good concentration of the data on the regression line indicationg that most of the data is rightly placed. the outliers can also be seemainly in the assymetry coeficcient and the kernel groove length.
