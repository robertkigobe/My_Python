President Museveni this week announced his first post-election Cabinet.

Judging by the reaction of the general public, the Opposition, the media and even a large cross-section of the ruling NRM party membership, this could prove to be the most belittled of any since 1986.

The general view is that this is a Cabinet that favours loyalty over competence and intellectualism, a view the President indirectly acknowledged in his response in which he borrowed a biblical metaphor of fishermen.

It had to do with humble but loyal folk selected by Jesus Christ as disciples versus the learned class of the New Testament Pharisees, scribes and teachers of the law.
The 2020-2021 Museveni election campaign message suggested a forward-looking, modernising drive. 
Social media posts from the Museveni task force highlighted the new four-lane highways, hydro-power dams, a revived Uganda Airlines and so forth.
